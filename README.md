  ### 4 quotes
«Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible» - Feynmann, R.

«On the overwhelming majority of jobs no more than an approximate forecast is needed, and if such a forecast cannot be made by simple means it cannot be made at all» ― Terzaghi, K.

«The responsibility of the design engineer is to judge soundly rather than to compute accurately» ― Hoek, E.

«The scientist's job is to explain natural phenomena. The engineer's is to deal with them wether they are adequately explained or not» Vick
