  ### 3 quotes
«Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible» ― Richard Feynmann

«On the overwhelming majority of jobs no more than an approximate forecast is needed, and if such a forecast cannot be made by simple means it cannot be made at all» ― Karl Von Terzaghi

«The responsibility of the design engineer is to judge soundly rather than to compute accurately» ― Evert Hoek
